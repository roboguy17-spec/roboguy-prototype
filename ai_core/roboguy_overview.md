# Robo Guy – Project Overview

Robo Guy is an emotionally intelligent AI companion designed to support users through adaptive interaction, emotional awareness, and ethical reasoning.

Unlike traditional AI systems that respond only to commands, Robo Guy focuses on understanding the user’s emotional state and responding in a supportive, human-centered way.

Robo Guy is designed to:
- Understand emotions, not just words
- Adapt to users over time
- Support mental, physical, educational, and personal growth
- Operate ethically and responsibly

This project is currently in prototype stage for the Hult Prize competition.
